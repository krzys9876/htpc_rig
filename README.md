# Home entertainment rig

This is a dump of various files related to the devices that I use in my home entertainment setup. 

## HTPC

A miniITX PC enclosed in custom case (see: [modushop.pl](https://www.modushop.pl/)). The PC is fanless, so I had to choose a relative low power processor and a good radiator. However, since I have a overhead projector with a loud fan it doesn't matter at all.

## Volumio player

A Raspberry Pi based Volumio player (see: [volumio.com](https://volumio.com)) enclosed in custom case. There are two Pis: one is a controller for two displays, the other is the actual player.

The controller uses a quick and dirty python script (it needs refactoring and one day I will do it).

## Power amp

Generally it works but I had to remove the power meters as it wasn't a good idea. Now I'm thinking about something different.

## Power supply

This was done just for fun - two DC suppies (5V, 12V) in a custom case with meters and fancy switches. Nothing super complicated, I just wanted to have a power supply of a concise look instead of a bunch of random wall socket supplies.

## Preamp

The purpose of this was actually to make a super fancy relay-based attenuator with custom arduino-like controller. So much fun when building, maybe not that much when using it but who cares, this is what DIY is all about.
